# Partner Environment

[![CI](https://github.com/place-labs/partner-environment/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/place-labs/partner-environment/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

For use when testing, improving or experimenting with PlaceOS on a local machine.
Use it for driver, frontend, api and infra development. Treat it as insecure.

When finished dev work for the day, stop the containers with `./placeos stop`

*NOT* for production use.

## Installation

1. `$ ./placeos start`
1. Navigate to https://localhost:8443/backoffice
1. Login with the credentials output by the CLI

## Configuration

- `PLACE_EMAIL`,`PLACE_PASSWORD`: Create an initial admin user via these environment variables
- `PLACE_DOMAIN`: Set an alternate application domain, defaults to `localhost:8443`

These environment variables can also be passed via the cli.
